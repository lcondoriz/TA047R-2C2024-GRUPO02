For example if the user selected the ""Search For Books"" widget then the config should look like the following.      {      ""global"": {},      ""env:development"": {},      ""env:test"": {},      ""env:production"": {},      ""os:ios"": {},      ""os:android"": {},      ""dependencies"": {          ""com.appcelerator.searchForBooks"":""1.0""      }  }",project8

2948,Improve Github PR submission,"The Github PR submission works OK, but could use some improvement in behavior/UI:  - If I have long commit messages the dialog gets very wide. It should have a max width set and just use horizontal scrolling if necessary  - The actual PR submission should happen asynchronously, it currently runs in the UI thread. (Schedule as user job, and show error in error dialog, success in toast as we do)  - The UI doesn't summarize the two endpoints being proposed for merging (let alone let user modify them). The dialog should show the name of the target repo and branch and the name of the current repo and branch.  - The success toast should give more details (like the generated PR number) and allow the user to click the toast to open the PR in a browser.

5457,Add polling twitter source ,"i've created a source module for polling a twitter timeline using the spring integration twitter inbound adapter. I've placed my api keys in the modules.yml file and verified that they are picked up by the twitterstream and twitterseach modules that come with SpringXD. However, they are not picked up by my custom module. I viewed the source for both the stream and and the search and i feel my project is near identical in configuration. Am i missing something or are these properties somehow special for just the two twitter sources that come with SpringXD?  I'd like to get this working and commit it to the project.",project6

Ideally these should be set in the configuration stage via TAC, but even during development they should be able to be set locally and manipulated via the context for testing (and for demoing by sales engineers).      It is not obvious to me whether this feature should be included in only the EE Studio.  That is one option.  Without this feature the ESB SE Studio would still have value, but it would effectively remove the SL from being used with the GUI designer.  This might not be a bad thing if we want to put more features into the EE.  After all, the TAC only comes with EE, and the SL manager likewise with EE.  Just a thought.    It s hard to say this is ""major"" from a tech perspective, but is does prevent us from demoing our full value proposition without stepping out into the code world.",project1
6104,Investigate missing boot's actuator endpoints in XD,"Currently, few of the boot's actuator endpoints go missing in the EndpointHandler mapping.  They are: BeansEndpoint, dumpEndpoint, traceEndpoint, healthEndpoint, infoEndpoint.    Also, the EndpointHandler mapping doesn't even happen in case of LauncherApplication.  I think this is because the LauncherApplication context starts with port '0' and the TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer sets the local port for it later. With port '0', the Endpointhandler mapping is disabled during the EndpointHandler mapping bean creation.",project6
8460,Enable `Option` to handle string literals gracefully,"In {{FlagsBase::add}}, MESOS-5064 begins making use of template function parameters like {{T2*}} for the default flag value rather than {{Option<T2>&}}. This is because in some places in the code base, we pass string literals for this argument. If an {{Option}} type is used, the compiler infers a {{char [x]}} type for {{T2}}, which breaks {{Option::getOrElse}}, which attempts to return that same type, since returning arrays is disallowed.    To fix this, we could employ {{std::decay}}, which would convert a return type of {{char [x]}} into {{const char *}}.",project5

6923,Bit Integrity Service: Incorrect report when item on list does not exist,"From David Arjanik (Columbia) on 12/15 Was unable to successfully complete Use Case 4: Preservation Monitoring Test. Here's an excerpt from my notes regarding 2.c of the use case test plan:   c. Service Test 1 i. Using the initial listing from Test0 above, create a new listing file with   some MD5s altered   some entire line items removed   some new line items  Arjanik: Done. Altered checksums of first three lines, deleted the next three lines, and added two lines at the end for files not in the DuraCloud instance. Uploaded to ""admin"" as usecase4-service-test-1.md5  ii. Run fixity service with this altered listing as input as in the previous test  Arjanik: Reconfigured service to run against this new md5 file. Report ran successfully, generating files fingerprints-service-test-1.csv and integrity-report-service-test-1.csv (names I specified in the reconfiguration).  iii. Verify that erroneous entries were identified in the generated report  Arjanik: Downloaded fingerprints-service-test-1.csv and integrity-report-service-test-1.csv. Arjanik: Checked integrity-report-service-test-1.csv. This file is attached. Only one line of report data: | space-id | content-id | 0:admin/usecase4-service-test-1.md5 | 1:admin/fingerprints-service-test-1.csv | status | | Invalid manifest file: newspace | README.txt | Error: metadata is null | for: newspace/README.txt |  Arjanik:    Deleted the new md5 file and the generated report files for this service test from the ""admin"" space to try again.   Reconfigured and re-deployed the service. Downloaded the results. Same results.   Edited the md5 file and replaced fictitious space ""newspace"" with ""usecase3"".   Deleted the old report files and re-deployed the service.   Downloaded the reports. Renamed the integrity report to integrity-report-service-test-1-2nd-try.csv and attached. Results are basically the same as before.   Opened the fingerprints file. The new lines were correctly identified as referring to files that didn't exist in DuraCloud.  The six files that I've attached:  PERFECT MATCH TEST usecase4.md5 - this is the input file listing correct space contents and correct md5 checksums fingerprints.csv - this is the md5 checksum file generated by the Bit Integrity Checker integrity-report.csv - this is the diff report generated by Bit Integrity Checker This test was successful.  ERRORS TEST: - The checksums of the first three files in the list were changed - The next three files were removed from the list. - The last two lines refer to files that are not in our DuraCloud instance. fingerprints-12-15-2010.csv - this file appears to use incorrect formatting in the last two lines, the lines with files that don't exist in the instance. integrity-report-12-15-2010.csv - this is the malformed integrity report.

4127,Spike: Determine options for configuring shared module dependencies,"h2. Narrative  As a developer, I'd like to be able to configure common dependencies for the entire environment.  An example could be that I use MySql for my databases.  I want to be able to configure the MySql driver once and have all modules use it.    h2. Back story  Spring Batch uses a database to store job state (the job repository).  This is a shared resource across all jobs (both custom developed and OOTB).  In order to support OOTB jobs, we'll need to have a way for users to provide the db driver to each module.  Ideally this would be possible without requiring that each of our OOTB modules be repackaged.  ",project6

It claims to have performance increases beyond the standard emulator making for a better development experience.    h2. Proposed Solution(s)    It would be good if you could specify by default whether you want to use the x86 or standard emulator for all projects, perhaps in {{Preferences -> Titanium Studio -> Titanium}}. It should be the standard emulator by default as the x86 emulator currently does not include the Google APIs (which would prevent the KitchenSink from running) and it does not support V8, as detailed in the linked ticket.    Also, it should be configurable on a per-project basis as well, for the same reasons I listed in the above paragraph.    So:    # We need to upgrade our AVI detection to show the available ABIs per device  # For devices with multiple ABIs we need to allow the user to select which one to use as part of the launch configuration, and that is passed as the first argument to the SDK for SDKs 2.1+.

I'm sure you guys have a good reason to add the prefix  but I don't see why. Unfortunately is  annoying when you are developing in a local VM where you can test the  simple authentication and after move the job to dev/prod environments with kerberos auth, the above because you must change your sqooptasklet configuration injecting the new parameters. If the SqoopTasklet allows inject those parameters directly from the hadoop.properties file you don't need change tasklet  configurations to run your jobs with different authentication methods.

8355,Hierarchical allocator inconsistently accounts for reserved resources. ,"Looking through the allocator code for MESOS-2099, I see an issue with respect to accounting reserved resources in the sorters:    Within {{HierarchicalAllocatorProcess::allocate}}, only unreserved resources are accounted for in the sorters, whereas everywhere else (add/remove framework, add/remove slave) we account for both reserved and unreserved.    From git blame, it looks like this issue was introduced over a long course of refactoring and fixes to the allocator. My guess is that this was never caught due to the lack of unit-testability of the allocator (unnecessarily requires a master PID to use an allocator).    From my understanding, the two levels of the hierarchical sorter should have the following semantics:    # Level 1 sorts across roles. Only unreserved resources are shared across roles, and therefore the ""role sorter"" for level 1 should only account for the unreserved resource pool.  # Level 2 sorts across frameworks, within a role. Both unreserved and reserved resources are shared across frameworks within a role, and therefore the ""framework sorters"" for level 2 should each account for the reserved resource pool for the role, as well as the unreserved resources _allocated_ inside the role.",project5

job execution.    In my view there are two major problems with this approach:    {panel}  h4. 1. I don't think it is appropriate to ""silently"" reconfigure the system wide keystore configuration just in order to run a consumer job.    A running TESB container can have many purposes, not only running several consumer jobs. There might be other bundles running which need the system wide SSL configuration as it is - or as the user has configured it himself. Using this approach a consumer job would *silently* change the SSL configuration for the whole VM and does not even restore the previous configuration (which also would not be a proper solution in my view). This might break other functionality running in this container.    Also you could think of problems when running consumer jobs with different configuration in parallel.      h4. 2. This approach setting the ssl system properties is not working when running the consumer job within the TESB container anyway. :)     After some (long) analysis - finally using jconsole and taking a look into the list of current system properties in the running consumer VM after having executed the consumer job - I've found out that the system properties are definitelly not set! Either the code is not been executed - or there is any security mechanism in Karaf disabling the possibility to set these properties programatically. I don't know.    As the path to the keystore file has not been set, the system uses the default Java truststore. Based on this the handshake with the correctly configured provider using Karaf HTTPS configuration fails, as the required certificate cannot be found in the default truststore on consumer side. A corresponding handshake exception is also visible on provider side:    {code}  javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: certificate_unknown      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Alerts.getSSLException(Alerts.java:174)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Alerts.getSSLException(Alerts.java:136)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.recvAlert(SSLSocketImpl.java:1806)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.readRecord(SSLSocketImpl.java:986)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.performInitialHandshake(SSLSocketImpl.java:1170)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.startHandshake(SSLSocketImpl.java:1197)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.startHandshake(SSLSocketImpl.java:1181)[:1.6]      at org.eclipse.jetty.server.ssl.SslSocketConnector$SslConnectorEndPoint.run(SslSocketConnector.java:659)[59:org.eclipse.jetty.server:7.4.5.v20110725]      at org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.QueuedThreadPool$3.run(QueuedThreadPool.java:529)[53:org.eclipse.jetty.util:7.4.5.v20110725]      at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:680)[:1.6.0_29]  {code}    As a _*workaround*_ I've set the same properties (_javax.net.ssl.trustStore_ and _javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword_) with the same configuration (path and password) as ""-D"" parameter in the TESB start script ""trun"" and have executed the same consumer job feature once again. The result was a successful request-response message exchange in this case.   {panel}    I think the proper and better approach for HTTPS configuration on consumer side with CXF is to _*create / generate a corresponding XML html-conduit configuration using spring/blueprint*_. As additional advantage this approach would also enable a setting which is not available with the normal Java SSL configuration: _*disabling the host verification*_ - which is a _*very helpful*_ feature for many usages and is been implemented by all containers (including Karaf) - except pure old Java itself. :) Such a solution would enable us to add a corresponding check box in the component. With the current approach (setting the SSL properties) such a feature is not available.    Please note that using *tSetKeystore* component instead of directly configuring SSL within the tESBConsumer component does not fix the problem as the approach of the generated code is the same.    => Find attached the exported consumer job as example.      <Additions Zsolt>  The settings for trust store and password are only meant for the stand alone case. It's anyway not the job of the job /route / service designer to specify the location of the trust store in the container. This is the responsibility of an admin. We should rather provide a way to specify these properties container wide and use them for all data service clients. These properties are:  - WSDL port name for which the configuration is valid  - location of the trust store and corresponding password  - location of the key store and corresponding password  - alias for the certificate  - host verification on / off  Of course it should be possible to specify configuration for several ports.    As usual part of this item is to add documentation for this feature.    </Additions Zsolt>",project1

In addition we should provide three standard configurations with the following port scheme    || ||orig. container||container 1||container 2||container 2||  ||HTTP Port|8040|8041|8042|8043|  ||HTTPS Port|9001|9002|9003|9004|  ||RMI Registry Port|1099|1100|1101|1102|   ||RMI Server Port|44444|44445|44446|44447|  ||SSH Port|8101|8102|8103|8104|  ||Command port|8000|8010|8020|8030|  ||File transfer port|8001|8011|8021|8031|  ||Monitoring port|8888|8898|8908|8918|         If possible provide aliases for the three standard configurations    Document the usage of the script and the three standard configurations in the Container Admin Guide.

So it's either {{stream deploy foo}} or {{stream deploy --all}}. This has a number of drawbacks, given that these are the only 2 alternatives:  - Implementation code is cumbersome  - None of the options can be marked mandatory, yet one of them is required. This has to be checked in the command code itself  - TAB completion is less powerful as the shell doesn't know if we want the first or the second form.

8132,Can not create service reference using blueprint for sam agent and locator features (Only Investigate a solution),The sam agent and locator features are currently publishing OSGi services that can be referenced in user bundles to add the features to endpoints and clients.    The problem is that the features are published with their concrete classes. This has two problems:  1. The user bundle needs to know the impl class name which should rather be hidden as an implementation detail  2. Blueprint create a proxy for each service it imports/references. This is not possible for concrete classes. Probably it can work using asm but this is a sure cause of headaches.    So I propose to additionally publish these features with the interface org.apache.cxf.feature.Feature. To identify them I propose to add a property id with these values:  locator: id=org.talend.esb.locator.feature  sam: id=org.talend.esb.sam.feature    I will add a patch. It would be nice to have this in 5.3.0 but it can be moved to 5.3.1,project1

This is not a regression. There is no log.    This is related to TISTUD-1666, but this is a separate edge case.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Create a new project.  2. Create a new module.  3. Package the module to the project.  4. Delete the module from the project using TiApp Editor Overview (click the red X to delete module).    This will dirty the tiapp.xml file and remove the module xml tags, but keep the module folder in the project.    5. While the editor is still dirty, package the module again to the project.    Expected Result:    Module should package and appear in TiAPP Editor Overview, xml tags for the module should exist in the tiapp.xml file.    Actual Result:    Module packages, but does not appear in the TiAPP Editor Overview. The xml tags are not generated.    It is worth noting the module tags will be added if the tiapp.xml file is dirty from other kinds of edits (i.e., changing the app version from 1.0 to 2.0).",project8

4773,Introduce an Either type.,"We currently don't have an abstraction in stout to capture the notion of having a container with many types and a single value. For example, in our abstractions like Try, rather than being able to say {{Either<Error, Value> t}} we must encode two Options ({{Option<Error>}}, {{Option<T>}}) with the implicit invariant that exactly one will be set.    This also comes in handy in many other places in the code. Note that we have the ability to (1) use C++11 unions now, as well as (2) use boost's variant directly instead of introducing Either. However, creating a named union every time this is needed is verbose, and unions require that we externally track which member is set. For variant, we already use this (e.g. json.hpp), but we can benefit from the better naming as Either.    Many languages expose Either as having only two values, left and right. I'd propose making this two or more, as is the case with variant.",project5

2484,"Studio: Android SDK detection relies on script in latest Titanium SDK in mobilesdk folder, giving misleading info during failure","Description:  To determine if the Android SDK is properly configured, Studio relies on a script (avd.py I believe) in the latest Titanium SDK in the Titanium SDK folder. This is problematic in some circumstances including when a developer installs a development Titanium SDK. Studio will automatically defer to this new version for verification of the correct configuration of the Android SDK. If there is an issue with the script or some other problem with the folder structure of the development Titanium SDK, it will disable the ability of Studio to use Android projects. Since it is not possible for QE to verify every development release has the correct structure and that the and.py script is present and functional, this is a potential risk area.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Configure studio to have 1.8.0.1 GA as the latest SDK  2) Install an SDK from master branch (1.9.0)  3) navigate to the folder for the 1.9.0 SDK and remove SDK FOLDER/android/avd.py  4) In studio, select the titanium preference pane or click ""configure..."" from the TIapp.xml overview    Result:  Android preference states ""Could not locate the Android SDK at the given path""    Expected:  Android SDK configuration verification based on method that is independent of Titanium SDK",project8

4601,Retrieval Tool to retrieve list of specific files,"I think the retrieval tool is missing an option where you can retrieve specific file(s) from a specific space.  So, in the DSpace use case, when doing a partial restore, you may wish to retrieve only a portion of the files from the space (rather than having to pull down all of them).  I would like to be able to request specific files by name (or by a comma separated list of names).  A regular expression could also work, but a list of exact names would seemingly meet the needs for DSpace. So, for DSpace, the AIP files stored in DuraCloud will have very specific names, similar to:  COLLECTION@123456789-10.zip ITEM@123456789-11.zip  Generally the AIP name is a specific format: <DSpace-Object-Type>@<DSpace-Object-identifier>.zip  So, if a DSpace install wanted to restore just a particular object (or small set of objects), it might be nice if they can request *just* those objects by name (rather than having to pull down their entire space).  I just know this is a specific case that's currently missing -- we either need a simple solution from the Retrieval tool, or we need a DSpace-specific tool to support partial content restores (where a user only wants to restore a particular set of items or a single collection).",project2

7621,Incremental data import with jdbchdfs job,"Enhance the current jdbchdfs job in spring-xd to have an incremental load / delta load feature similar to sqoop. See sqoop documentation [here|http://sqoop.apache.org/docs/1.4.5/SqoopUserGuide.html#_incremental_imports]. The job will need to maintain some state between executions in order to decide the start point for the next data load.     The jdbchdfs job definition could take the following 2 new options.     h5. checkColumn   optional  Specifies the column to be examined when determining which rows to import. (the column should not be of type CHAR/NCHAR/VARCHAR/VARNCHAR/ LONGVARCHAR/LONGNVARCHAR). Column should be numeric or timestamp.  h5. lastValue   optional  If specified this will override any data saved from previous job runs. If not specified will take the saved max-value from the last job run. If no last job run data is available then it will not be an incremental load and all the data which satisfies the query will be used.    Sqoop provides 2 modes of operation for incremental load, 'append' and 'lastModified'. For jdbchdfs the job will always append as it is writing to a hdfs file.    Example: To import data from the database table some_table which has a last update column called lastUpdated, you could use.  {code}  xd:> job create myjob --definition ""jdbchdfs --sql='select col1,col2,col3 from some_table' --checkColumn=lastUpdated"" --deploy  {code}    The batch job should also be capable of being partitioned to run in parallel across multiple containers",project6

9037,Spring XD admin fails to redeploy modules after Spring XD container successfully reconnectes to Zookeeper,"We are running Spring XD 1.1.1 in our production environment and Zookeeper 3.4.5.  Zookeeper is running in failover mode and consists of three independent nodes set up on three separate VMs. From time to time we get ""Connection to Zookeeper Suspended"" event which causes one of the containers in the cluster to be removed from the SpringXD cluster. Modules being deployed on this removed node fail to be re-deployed to other containers in the cluster.    Affected versions:  - SpringXD 1.1.1  - Zookeeper 3.4.5 and 3.4.6    Cluster set up in PROD environment where error occurs:  - 4 Spring-XD dedicated servers  - 4 spring-xd containers (each running on designated server )  - 2 spring-xd admins ( each running alongside one spring-xd container)  - 3 Zookeeper nodes ( 3 designated servers on PAITO environment )    Cluster set up in TEST environment where error also occurred:  - 2 Spring-XD dedicated servers running one spring-xd container and one spring-xd admin each  - 3 Zookeeper nodes running on 3 dedicated servers (PAITO Test environment)    Cluster set up to reproduce error found in PROD environment:  - 1 spring-xd admin  - 3 spring xd-containers (each running on a designated VM )  - 3 zookeeper servers running on one VM    Steps to reproduce:    1)	Set up three node Zookeeper cluster. Attached is example zoo.cfg, we are using default configuration values. In this particular test case we run all Zookeeper nodes on a single VM as we were not testing network layer interruptions.  2)	Set up one Spring XD admin node. Please note that we have also observed this on two node Spring XD admin cluster.   3)	Set up three Spring XD container nodes. All of them belong to one group (SA) and two of them also belong to second group (HA1). This is configured in $XD_HOME/config/servers.yml however so far group configuration never influenced test outcome.  4)	Create and deploy a test stream using following XD Shell commands:  stream create --name test-zookeeper-failover --definition ""syslog-udp --port=5140 | transform | file --dir='/opt/pivotal/spring-xd/xd/output'""  stream deploy --name test-zookeeper-failover --properties ""module.syslog-udp.criteria=groups.contains('HA1'),module.syslog-udp.count=2,module.file.criteria=groups.contains('SA'),module.file.count=3,module.transform.criteria=groups.contains('SA')""  5)	Ensure that test stream works and handles traffic on UDP port 5140  6)	Shutdown one of the Zookeeper nodes by issuing a stop command.  7)	Two Spring XD containers were not affected and remained in Spring XD cluster.  8)	One Spring XD container was kicked out of Spring XD cluster and was no longer visible on Spring XD admin Web UI. Modules previously deployed to this container were not redeployed to other cluster members.  9)	On the failed Spring XD container we have observed CONNECTION_SUSPEND, CONNECTION_RECONECTED and CHILD_REMOVE Zookeeper events (attached is container-log.txt). Please note that Java process is still running and we see “ConnectionStateManager-0 server.ContainerRegistrar - Waiting for supervisor to clean up prior deployments�? messages.  10)	Spring XD admin failed with exception in DepartingContainerModuleRedeployer (attached is admin-log.txt).   11)	We have observed that departing container node in Zookeeper (/sa/deployments/modules/allocated/1d3fd4cc-5a70-47ed-b4f3-22deef1f4d4f/) had no children. We did this after few minutes so we are not sure at which point it was cleared.   12)	Restarting failed Spring XD container fixed the problem, modules were correctly redeployed.  Exception from point 10 is very similar to XD-1983 and this code was rewritten in XD-2004.  ",project6

The current mechanism doesn't provide a way through the module API to forbid multiple instantiations. It is up to the module to check and return error on prior instantiation.    Along similar lines, a module should be able to express thread-safety concerns. Typically, a module running in Master/Agent doesn't have to be concerned about thread safety if it uses libprocess API.

Additional issues will be created once done.  Also see [the parent issue|MESOS-3820].    {{process::finalize}} should cover the following components:  * {{__s__}} (the server socket)  ** {{delete}} should be sufficient.  This closes the socket and thereby prevents any further interaction from it.  * {{process_manager}}  ** Related prior work: [MESOS-3158]  ** Cleans up the garbage collector, help, logging, profiler, statistics, route processes (including [this one|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/3bda55da1d0b580a1b7de43babfdc0d30fbc87ea/3rdparty/libprocess/src/process.cpp#L963], which currently leaks a pointer).  ** Cleans up any other {{spawn}} 'd process.  ** Manages the {{EventLoop}}.  * {{Clock}}  ** The goal here is to clear any timers so that nothing can deference {{process_manager}} while we're finalizing/finalized.  It's probably not important to execute any remaining timers, since we're ""shutting down"" libprocess.  This means:  *** The clock should be {{paused}} and {{settled}} before the clean up of {{process_manager}}.  *** Processes, which might interact with the {{Clock}}, should be cleaned up next.  *** A new {{Clock::finalize}} method would then clear timers, process-specific clocks, and {{tick}} s; and then {{resume}} the clock.  * {{__address__}} (the advertised IP and port)  ** Needs to be cleared after {{process_manager}} has been cleaned up.  Processes use this to communicate events.  If cleared prematurely, {{TerminateEvents}} will not be sent correctly, leading to infinite waits.  * {{socket_manager}}  ** The idea here is to close all sockets and deallocate any existing {{HttpProxy}} or {{Encoder}} objects.  ** All sockets are created via {{__s__}}, so cleaning up the server socket prior will prevent any new activity.  * {{mime}}  ** This is effectively a static map.  ** It should be possible to statically initialize it.  * Synchronization atomics {{initialized}} & {{initializing}}.  ** Once cleanup is done, these should be reset.    *Summary*:  * Implement {{Clock::finalize}}.

However, in the bottom-right corner of Studio, there is an ongoing process (see Screen Shot 2014-05-28).   Expected result: Studio should show no ongoing process.    2.

Due to hard limit (100 changeset parsed for the build, no more) the Mercurial Repository falsely filters out the not-relevant changesets to current branch:  bq. The Mercurial Plugin might incorrectly report the changesets triggering the build *if* there was more than 100 (HgRepository.CHANGESET_LIMIT) changes between the last build. The Mercurial Plugin will just have not enough information to traverse the changeset graph properly and will in defense report all changesets between, even those non-related to the built branch.

Or, via a new plugin handling module undeployments - in the rabbit case, undeploying a consumer would check for us being the last consumer and remove the queue/binding/exchange, since we undeploy left->right, everything can be cleaned up on the consumer side.  * Third option would be new methods on the bus {{cleanConsumer}} etc invoked by the {{StreamPlugin}}  * Down side of doing it on the admin is that he wouldn't necessarily know which rabbit cluster a stream was deployed to - so it probably has to happen on the container - even so, we'd need the admin url(s) for the cluster.",project6

I was thinking that this could be accomplished with an html/css/javascript app that is stored in one of the user's spaces, and allows them to select a space (if that's actually necessary, could be hard coded to the one that is their image library) and view a set of images. The javascript would need to make calls to the DuraCloud REST API to get the list of content items and display each one. The images would likely be scaled down a bit, to make browsing easier, and clicking on them would display the (slightly) larger size. The REST API would also be used to allow paging through the content items (and not trying to display too many at once). The option to specify a prefix for filtering would need to be there, and the user would need to be able to see the full content ID of the item they are viewing, since that will be the link back to the full size archival image on their internal system.  There is an expectation that the UNC folks will be generating the necessary low-res images that would be viewed through this gallery viewer, and would load those images into a DuraCloud space.",project2

8019,Studio: TiApp editor module section - Platform icons could use some improvement,"Description:  The QE team like the new TiApp editor features. The icons however seem to have some room for improvement.

Second, the three letters used to signify iPad and iPhone are difficult to decipher: ""iPa"" and ""iPh"".  2) While most OSes have the header in white, Linux is grey, making the Android icon difficult to make out as the contrast is too low.    An additional concern may be the sourcing of the icons    Steps to reproduce:  1) Install Studio 2.0 on any system (linux for Android icon contrast evaluation)  2) Create a new project  3) Edit the TiApp.xml  4) Note the Module section in the editor overview    Result:  Icons less than ideal    Expected:  Icons are beautiful",project8

8683,Image Conversion Service should write output more frequently,The process for reporting image conversion results should be updated so that the output file is created and continually updated as the conversion activity progresses.

7840,Create light-weight executor only and scheduler only mesos eggs,"Currently, when running tasks in docker containers, if the executor uses the mesos.native python library, the execution environment inside the container (OS, native libs, etc) must match the execution environment outside the container fairly closely in order to load the mesos.so library.    The solution here can be to introduce a much lighter weight python egg, mesos.executor, which only includes code (and dependencies) needed to create and run an MesosExecutorDriver.  Executors can then use this native library instead of mesos.native.",project5

3918,Master anonymous modules should initialized before any other components.,"Anonymous modules on the Master are by design supposed to be independent of any Mesos components. However, there might be a dependency in the reverse direction. For e.g., Anonymous modules might want to influence the behavior of Mesos components (say by generating configuration, that might be consumed later by the components).     The Anonymous modules on the Master therefore need to be initialized before other Mesos components. ",project5
7746,Handling tap operations on a tap that has reference to a deleted stream,"When trying to undeploy/destroy a tap that has reference to an already deleted stream fails with the following exception: Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: XD116E:(pos 4): unrecognized stream reference '<stream_name at the tap defintion>'.  As expected, the StreamConfigParser's lookupStream fails to find the stream name as the stream doesn't exist in the repository.   In this scenario, what is a better way to handle the tap operations.  Should we undeploy the tap when the stream is destroyed? ( though I don't see an easy way to find the taps that use a specific stream).",project6

Seems that the additional sleep process is not necessary. The slave can just monitor the duration and send a SIGINT to the perf process when duration elapsed. This will cause the perf process to output the stats and terminate.",project5

8065,Performance issue in libprocess SocketManager.,"Noticed an issue in production under which the master is slow to respond after failover for ~15 minutes.    After looking at some perf data, the top offender is:    {noformat}      12.02%  mesos-master  libmesos-0.21.0-rc3.so  [.] std::_Rb_tree<process::ProcessBase*, process::ProcessBase*, std::_Identity<process::ProcessBase*>, std::less<process::ProcessBase*>, std::allocator<process::ProcessBase*> >::erase(process::ProcessBase* const&)  ...       3.29%  mesos-master  libmesos-0.21.0-rc3.so  [.] process::SocketManager::exited(process::ProcessBase*)  {noformat}    It appears that in the SocketManager, whenever an internal Process exits, we loop over all the links unnecessarily:    {code}  void SocketManager::exited(ProcessBase* process)  {    // An exited event is enough to cause the process to get deleted    // (e.g., by the garbage collector), which means we can't    // dereference process (or even use the address) after we enqueue at    // least one exited event. Thus, we save the process pid.    const UPID pid = process->pid;      // Likewise, we need to save the current time of the process so we    // can update the clocks of linked processes as appropriate.    const Time time = Clock::now(process);      synchronized (this) {      // Iterate through the links, removing any links the process might      // have had and creating exited events for any linked processes.      foreachpair (const UPID& linkee, set<ProcessBase*>& processes, links) {        processes.erase(process);          if (linkee == pid) {          foreach (ProcessBase* linker, processes) {            CHECK(linker != process) << ""Process linked with itself"";            synchronized (timeouts) {              if (Clock::paused()) {                Clock::update(linker, time);              }            }            linker->enqueue(new ExitedEvent(linkee));          }        }      }        links.erase(pid);    }  }  {code}    On clusters with 10,000s of slaves, this means we hold the socket manager lock for a very expensive loop erasing nothing from a set! This is because, the master contains links from the Master Process to each slave. However, when a random ephemeral Process terminates, we don't need to loop over each slave link.    While we hold this lock, the following calls will block:    {code}  class SocketManager  {  public:    Socket accepted(int s);    void link(ProcessBase* process, const UPID& to);    PID<HttpProxy> proxy(const Socket& socket);    void send(Encoder* encoder, bool persist);    void send(const Response& response,              const Request& request,              const Socket& socket);    void send(Message* message);    Encoder* next(int s);    void close(int s);    void exited(const Node& node);    void exited(ProcessBase* process);  ...  {code}    As a result, the slave observers and the master can block calling send()!    Short term, we will try to fix this issue by removing the unnecessary looping. Longer term, it would be nice to avoid all this locking when sending on independent sockets.",project5

This even holds if multiple tasks request the same URI concurrently. If multiple requests for the same URI occur, perform only one of them and reuse the result. Make concurrent requests for the same URI wait for the one download.     Different URIs from different CommandInfos can be downloaded concurrently.    No cache eviction, cleanup or failover will be handled for now. Additional tickets will be filed for these enhancements. (So don't use this feature in production until the whole epic is complete.)    Note that implementing this does not suffice for production use. This ticket contains the main part of the fetcher logic, though. See the epic MESOS-336 for the rest of the features that lead to a fully functional fetcher cache.    The proposed general approach is to keep all bookkeeping about what is in which stage of being fetched and where it resides in the slave's MesosContainerizerProcess, so that all concurrent access is disambiguated and controlled by an ""actor"" (aka libprocess ""process"").    Depends on MESOS-2056 and MESOS-2069.  ",project5

6870,Do not call hook manager if no hooks installed,"Hooks modules allow us to provide decorators during various aspects of a task lifecycle such as label decorator, environment decorator, etc.  Often the call into such a decorator hooks results in a new copy of labels, environment, etc., being returned to the call site. This is an unnecessary overhead if there are no hooks installed.    The proper way would be to call decorators via the hook manager only if there are some hooks installed. This would prevent unnecessary copying overhead if no hooks are available.",project5
2013,Mac Installer: Layout of the prerequisites are overlapped when going back and forth the installer steps,"Prerequisites: no java 1.7 and node.js should be installed in the computer.    The installer has several steps and when it comes to prerequisites it prompts node and java1.7 to be installed if you click 'continue' the display of the progress of download is fine. However, instead if you go back and forth the steps in the installer, then the words and progress of the download of node and java overlaps as shown in the attachment.    Steps to reproduce:  1.Download the studio installer for OS X  2. Open the appcelerator studio package to install studio  3. Click continue until you hit the 'prerequisites' step  4. Click 'back' button in prerequisites step  5. Click continue again to go to prerequisites page  6. Click on continue    Actual Results:  2. Installer UI opens up   3. Prerequisites page is shown with Java and node to be installed  4. 'Installation type' is shown  5. Prerequisites page is shown with Java and node to be installed  6. The installation starts however the display of the progress is overlapped with the words as shown in the attachment    Expected Results:  6. The words and the progress bar for both node and java should not be overlapped.    Note: If you do not go back and forth the overlap of the words and the progress bar does not happen. ",project8

2464,Harden the CMake system-dependency-locating routines,"Currently the Mesos project has two flavors of dependency: (1) the dependencies we expect are already on the system (_e.g._, apr, libsvn), and (2) the dependencies that are historically bundled with Mesos (_e.g._, glog).    Dependency type (1) requires solid modules that will locate them on any system: Linux, BSD, or Windows. This would come for free if we were using CMake 3.0, but we're using CMake 2.8 so that Ubuntu users can install it out of the box, instead of upgrading CMake first.    This is additionally useful for dependency type (2), where we will expect to have to use these routines when we support both the rebundled dependencies in the `3rdparty/` folder, and system installations of those dependencies.",project5

9028,Enforce that DiskInfo principal is equal to framework/operator principal,"Currently, we require that {{ReservationInfo.principal}} be equal to the principal provided for authentication, which means that when HTTP authentication is disabled this field cannot be set. Based on comments in 'mesos.proto', the original intention was to enforce this same constraint for {{Persistence.principal}}, but it seems that we don't enforce it. This should be changed to make the two fields equivalent, with one exception: when the framework/operator principal is {{None}}, we should allow the principal in {{DiskInfo}} to take any value, along the same lines as MESOS-5212.",project5

6301,Export limitations for ESB 'Jobs',"Currently we see two issues which lead user to wrong actions and which we can (easily) prevent in our studio:    - Export of an SOAP Data Service (single operation) job. In some cases customers tried to export a single tESBProviderRequest job which implements a single operation as a single OSGi for ESB Runtime export. We should prevent exporting and publishing of these kind of jobs (which includes a tESBProviderRequest component ) completly as and export / publishing should only be done in the 'Service' node level on the Repository menu.    - Any ESB Job (e.g with tESBConsumer, tRESTRequest, tRESTClient should be limited to 'ESB for OSGi' & (for tESBConsumer and tRESTClient ) also 'Anonymous exports only. All other export options should be inactive / removed fromt eh Export Options combo box for these kind of ESB Jobs.    Changes also should be applied to commandline.    ",project1

9735,Make npm packages required installs and not allow user to dismiss required installs,"We currently prompt for some required installs/updates but not in some cases. An example is that if the user has no Titanium SDK installed we will silently install one for them. But we prompt the user to install Titanium SDK updates, NPM packages (and updates), Node.js.    If a given component is required, we should not allow the user to dismiss the install - thus helping to avoid invalid setups because user's didn't accept. Obviously, this will still force sudo prompts on Mac/Linux for some of the installs right now (since npm packages are installed globally, and I think we need sudo rights for installing Node?).    From Aditya:  {quote}  I can't count the number of times over the past several weeks where we have worked with every developer, tester, partner etc. and they only complete half the setup because they don't read the docs.  E.g. ""Oh I need Xcode/Android sdk?""  or ""Oh I ignored that failure message on setting up node.js"" or ""oh I need to accept and install all the updates from Studio?""  {quote}",project8

Though BB is not configured on my machine, it still shows some invalid default path set in the Preference tab.  4. When I try to click on any other option in the Preference tab, an error pop up message is prompted ""The currently displayed page contains invalid values"".    Actual result:   When OK is clicked user is again navigated to the same tab and any other operation gets stuck. User can not navigate to any other tab. Though 'Restore defaults' option clears the path and solves the problem but every time when Blackberry Preferences is opened in the Preference tab same problem occurs.

5965,Refactor the Titanium project wizard to have Android plugin contribute its entry,"Currently the Titanium project wizard defines all the checkboxes for deployment targets. We should have the Android plugin contribute the following attributes through the extension point from TISTUD-3066:    1. A display name (""Android"");  2. A string for platform type (""android"") that will be used by CLI and other necessary operations;  3. A mean to check if the requirement for platform support is met, i.e. if the Titanium SDK contains the platform, if the platform SDK is installed (not applicable to Mobile Web), and if the OS supports the platform (not applicable here either), so the project wizard could enable/disable the checkbox as appropriate. It should return a status so we could display a warning or error message if needed.  4. Potentially a post-project creation hook to perform any Android specific task needed (don't think we have any?).  5. An optional ""priority"" attribute to control the order of the platforms both here and in tiapp.xml. Currently we are sorting them in alphabetical order, but there might be a case in the future where we like to have the flexibility.  ",project8

4827,"Static files missing ""Last-Modified"" HTTP headers","Static assets served by the Mesos master don't return ""Last-Modified"" HTTP headers. That means clients receive a 200 status code and re-download assets on every page request even if the assets haven't changed. Because Angular JS does most of the work, the downloading happens only when you navigate to Mesos master in your browser or use the browser's refresh.    Example header for ""mesos.css"":        HTTP/1.1 200 OK      Date: Thu, 26 Sep 2013 17:18:52 GMT      Content-Length: 1670      Content-Type: text/css    Clients sometimes use the ""Date"" header for the same effect as ""Last-Modified"", but the date is always the time of the response from the server, i.e. it changes on every request and makes the assets look new every time.    The ""Last-Modified"" header should be added and should be the last modified time of the file.

7808,Studio Formatter behaves incorrectly causing JSHint errors,"I have noticed that the formatter used within the Studio application has a number of issues that are causing me and my team a lot of difficulties when working with different tools and attempting to maintain a high level of code quality.    1. Studio reformats functions and var declarations within functions incorrectly. I say incorrect as it can cause JSHint errors afterwards also existing formatting applied, say by developer A, gets reformatted by Studio when developer B edits the documents.    Here is an example of a small function example that has been formatted with Sublime Text 2 and passes JSHint. It is also the style that I wish to use, which also is recommended in many books regarding code quality with JavaScript.    {code:title=FormattingCorrect.js|borderStyle=solid}  /**   * Test File for Appcelerator Studio Formatting Bug   *   * @author Ketan Majmudar   */    /**   * Example Function that maintains a space after the function parantheses and the braces.   * variable declaration within is indented for readibility and also allows for git merges   * to be easily reviewed. The   *   * ""use strict""; is used internally and is another issue when the Studio foramtter is used,   *  it throws errors when using JSLint and should respect certain code style guide conventions.   *   */    function exampleFunction() {      ""use strict"";      var myVar1,          myVar2,          myVar3;        switch (myVar1) {      case true:          myVar3 = true;          break;      case false:          myVar3 = false;          break;      default:          myVar3 = null;      }      Ti.API.log(myVar1 + myVar2 + myVar3);  }    exports.exampleFunction = exampleFunction;  {code}    If this is copy/pasted into Studio, and you use the Source Format option, by default or with custom settings, a few things happen that break the styling and flow.    The ""use strict""; statement is placed immediately to the right of the opening brace, the variables are all moved onto a single line, and switch statements re-indent themselves.    This is very frustrating when you are working on multiple branches of a project and the commits are going back and forth due to formatting changes made by the product. Take a look at what Studio does to the code example:    {code:title=FormattingBroken.js|borderStyle=solid}  /**   * Test File for Appcelerator Studio Formatting Bug   *   * @author Ketan Majmudar   */    /**   * Example Function that maintains a space after the function parantheses and the braces.   * variable declaration within is indented for readibility and also allows for git merges   * to be easily reviewed. The   *   * ""use strict""; is used internally and is another issue when the Studio foramtter is used,   *  it throws errors when using JSLint and should respect certain code style guide conventions.   *   */    function exampleFunction() {""use strict"";      var myVar1, myVar2, myVar3;        switch (myVar1) {          case true:              myVar3 = true;              break;          case false:              myVar3 = false;              break;          default:              myVar3 = null;      }      Ti.API.log(myVar1 + myVar2 + myVar3);  }    exports.exampleFunction = exampleFunction;  {code}    The case should be indented with the switch, the vars should stay on a newline and the ""use strict""; should not move.    This raises a wider question as why we can't use JSBeautifer rules/tags for certain settings. The formatting options and rules probably would better serve us if they adopted more of this standard approach that is more widely adopted. (just an idea).    My main issue is this current reformatting.    Key Issues that need to be addressed:  * ""use strict""; should not reflow immediately after the brace  * var declarations on newlines should not all be placed on a single line  * switch statements should not indent cases.",project8

In this case, it was determined that the developer name which should read something like ""Eric Merriman (9JU76422)"" is being trimmed by studio and passed as ""Eric Merriman"".     The problem with this technique is that we were trying to use Developer name ""Eric Merriman (W6xxxxx)"" and were getting a certificate mismatch.    To prevent this, the full developer name should be passed, including the ""(9JU76422)""    Steps to reproduce:  1) Using a configured system that includes multiple identities, attempt to build for device using one of the multiple identities (the one appearing second in ""Titanium info"")    Result:  Studio reports that the identity (the one you didn't select) doesn't match the provision, and fails    Expected:  The identity selected in the build dialog is the one used for the build  ",project8

In this sense it nicely fits to the requirements of a client interface for the registry that folloes the REST style.   As first step this feature is about the corresponding APP based interface for policy documents. The registry needs to provide a collection resource following the APP specification for policies. It must be possible to add, update and delete policies to the collection as specified in the spec. All mandatory meta data must be provided, especially the corresponding link elements. The policies itselve must be included within a content element as XML. We need to invent our own proprietary MIME media type for policy documents (if none yet exists) to be used as type attribute for the content element.    ID's used within meta data or URL's must be opaque (no policy name). Also HTTP staus codes should be used as specified in the specs.    Update documentation reflecting the new APP based interface. Especially provide sample requests and responses for the new interface. Document possible error situations and corresponding HTTP status codes.",project1

We'll change the following    *Shard allocation*    Shard allocation will not perform a propose + check phase. The following algorithm will occur.  This must occur at EACH_QUORUM to ensure that we have consensus across regions.      Any node will propose a new shard pivot.  This pivot will have compacted set to false, and will have a column timestamp of a new timeuuid in micros    The proposing node will then read back all compacted = false shard pivots.  The shard pivot with the minimum timestamp will be retained, all others will be deleted as proposals.  This will function similarly to distributed read locks in Cassandra.  Lowest proposed value always wins.     Allocation is complete    *Shard compaction*    After a successful proposal allocation, the allocating node will copy all edges from the previously compacted shard into the new shard.  It will continue to copy until no new edges are returned on read.    Once read has been completed, all edges that were copied can be deleted from the previous shard.

6308,Studio Dashboard and Platform configuration wizards conflicts for Android SDK setup status,"Studio Dashboard shows Android SDK is not installed, while platform configuration wizard shows that Android SDK is properly installed. So, It *does not allows further installation into the same location.*    Possible Reason for this problem is:  If the Android SDK set up fails in middle of installation, it leaves some partial SDK files into the specified destination folder. It causes the problem in Android SDK detection process of Studio.    This is *not a regression* since it happens in Studio 3.3.0 as well.    h5. Steps to Reproduce  1. Delete your Android SDK installation.  2. Start installation from Studio Dashboard  3. After installation starts, disconnect your network for some time.  4. Installation will fail and leave some files into specified location.  5. If you try to set up Android SDK into the same location, this scenario will happen.    Expected Result:  Android SDK installation should succeed.   We could clean the folder if the installation fails before completion.",project8

2554,Enable a framework to perform reservation operations.,"h3. Goal    This is the first step to supporting dynamic reservations. The goal of this task is to enable a framework to reply to a resource offer with *Reserve* and *Unreserve* offer operations as defined by {{Offer::Operation}} in {{mesos.proto}}.    h3. Overview    It's divided into a few subtasks so that it's clear what the small chunks to be addressed are. In summary, we need to introduce the {{Resource::ReservationInfo}} protobuf message to encapsulate the reservation information, enable the C++ {{Resources}} class to handle it then enable the master to handle reservation operations.    h3. Expected Outcome    * The framework will be able to send back reservation operations to (un)reserve resources.  * The reservations are kept only in the master since we don't send the {{CheckpointResources}} message to checkpoint the reservations on the slave yet.  * The reservations are considered to be reserved for the framework's role.",project5

In StreamTestSupport, the @BeforeClass has this line:    moduleDeployer = containerContext.getBean(ModuleDeployer.class);    When JMX is enable, the IntegrationMBeanExporter creates JdkDynamicProxy for the ModuleDeployer (since it is of type MessageHandler) and thereby the above line to get bean by the implementing class type (ModuleDeployer) fails.

7646,Studio: Expose android keystore for Android non-production builds,"Studio asks for keystore, alias, and password when packaging Android applications. This information is not requested when running in emulator or on device. If the android builder.py is not passed a keystore it uses the default keystore shipped with the SDK.    The issue with this is that people who wish to use an app key, for say Google maps v2, are directed to use the default keystore to generate a debug key, and to generate their own keystore to create a production key.    This could eventually lead to situations where multiple keys are associated with the same keystore on the google side.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Create an android project in studio  2) Attempt to package the project - note the dialog requesting Keystore info  3) Attempt to run on device    Result:  THe default keystore is used since no keystore passed to builder.py.    Expected:  Prompt for keystore",project8

8419,Create a JPMML module that will evaluate a model.,"A analytical model should be evaluated as a processor in a stream.  The model evaluation will take the input variables from a Tuple and output variable will be placed into the tuple as well.    A strawman of the stream definition can be     stream create --definition "" SOURCE | jpmml ‘fraud-detection’ | PROC1 … | PROCN "" --name stream1    Using profiles and playing all implementations of the analytical model in the same module lib directory, it maybe possible to select one of multiple implementations in the form     "" SOURCE | analytic --library=jpmml --name=‘fraud-detection’ | PROC1 … | PROCN ""    such that the core module name is the same but parameterized by what library type to use.  This may be problematic in that different libraries may have incompatible dependencies.    The analytical model can define the names of input and output fields, so at a minimum a name is required, however to easily adapt a given analytic model evaluation to a specific source modules output, it seems desirable to specify which fields are to be used as input, overriding the names of the input fields could be done in a manner such as     jpmml –name=linear-regresssion –inputFields=a,b,c ",project6

'Add' button: create 2 subitems: 'Feature' and 'Profile'  2. In case Add->Feature: in Metadata show feature fields (as for now)  3. In case Add->Profile: in Metadata show profile fields.  4.

This means the expected behavior (finish or OOM) is dependent on the offer size.  * The framework assumes the {{balloon-executor}} binary is available on each agent.  This is generally only true in the build environment or in single-agent test environments.  * The framework does not specify CPUs with the executor.  This is required by many isolators.  * The executor's {{TASK_FINISHED}} logic path was untested and is flaky.  * The framework has no metrics.  * The framework only launches a single task and then exits.  With this behavior, we can't have useful metrics.  ",project5

8927,Content properties are being overwritten when content stream changes.,"When the content of an item changes locally and is resynced to duracloud, the custom metadata (properties and tags) are wiped out.  To reproduce follow these steps:   1. add a file using the upload applet 2. add a custom property and tag to the content item. 3. change the file on your local machine by adding text to the end of it. 4. resync it using the upload applet. 5. verify that the content metadata is no longer there.  Another symptom of this problem:  if you log in as userX on the initial content item creation and then login as userY when uploading the changed content item, notice ""creator"" property changes from userX to userY.

8593,Package modules with their support jars,"Currently, a lot of jars that are on the classpath of xd-dirt are there to support modules.  We should move those to the lib/ construct of a module and remove them from the CP of dirt.    But this should not be done by simple ""mv"", as we'd lose version tracking and dependency management offered by gradle.    Pending a ""dependency-aware"" ModuleRegistry, we should be able to alter the build.gradle file so that it  - knows about individual modules (maybe handles them as project)  - copies its libs into the appropriate directory  - does not copy dependencies that are already legitimate dependencies of xd-dirt (this can be achieved by runtime introspection of the dependeny tree of both projects)    ",project6

9493,Users with USER role should be able to view streams on open spaces,"When a space is set to open streaming (by turning streaming on via DurAdmin), any user with read access to that space should be able to view media (audio/video) that is streamed through the built-in player. Currently, this works fine for admin users, but users with only USER role just see ""Unable to stream file"" where the player should be.    This is very likely to be caused by the fact that a task call is being made to retrieve the streaming URL, but that task call is limited to admin users. A user with access to a space should be able to make the task request to stream content from that space.",project2

With the new HTTP API (see MESOS-2288, MESOS-2289), there will be no need to link to libmesos to a framework for it to communicate with a Mesos master. However, if a framework uses the Mesos ""state abstraction"", either directly in C++ or through other language bindings (e.g., Java), it still needs to link with libmesos. So, in order to achieve libmesos-free frameworks that can leverage all APIs Mesos has to offer, we need a different way to access the ""state abstraction"".     ---    One approach is to provide an HTTP API for state queries that get routed through the Mesos master, which relays them by making calls into libmesos.

The solution would probably be to have the IDE run it directly if/when it isn't already running. The syntax for starting and stopping the server is pretty straight forward:  $MOBILESDK/android/fastdev.py start <path/to/project> $MOBILESDK/android/fastdev.py stop <path/to/project>  You can check if the server is running by looking for an existing lock file in:  <path/to/project>/.fastdev.lock",project8

6926,Invalid resources sent to '/reserve' are silently dropped,"If an invalid resource is passed to the master's {{/reserve}} endpoint, it will be silently dropped and not cause an error. This can lead, for example, to a {{/reserve}} request containing a single invalid resource receiving a 200 OK response, despite the fact that no resources were reserved as a result of the request.    This is due to the fact that the {{+=}} operator for {{Resources}} silently drops invalid resources, and this operator is used when parsing the resources in the HTTP request. This could be addressed by validating the resource objects one at a time as they are parsed.",project5
1746,Download Multiple Items as a zip or tar archival file.,"This feature sprung into my mind:  it is not driven by user requests, but it seemed that it would be very handy especially once we have a search index for listing content items.   The idea is that it might be useful to be able to download multiple content items in one zip archive.  This would be especially useful if one needed to extract a large number of small files. You could select items either based on a search query or a list of contentIds.  I was envisioning it would work both at the durastore as well as duradmin levels.  You would issue a request for an archive and immediately receive a handle.  One could optionally specify an email address. The handle would enable you to get the status of the request.  When the request is complete, if an email address had been specified,  the user would receive an email with a link to the download page.  Otherwise the download URI would be available via a status query using the request handle.  Once the archive had been downloaded and verified the user could then make a call to remove download site.  If no call was made after a standard expiration time, the download would be removed automatically.  Regarding limits: Initially the total size limit would be constrained by the available server side disk space.  Obviously this is not going to work for extremely large downloads, ie greater than 100 GBs.   ",project2
10,Retrieval Tool:  Verify chunked manifests when generating prechunked listing,"It would be nice if we could tell the retrieval tool to verify that the manifest points to a complete set of chunks and that the chunk md5s match the manifest md5s.

5843,Alloy Debugger: wrong behavior setting breakpoints on functions under Android,"h5. Problem description  Debugger is not correctly handling a breakpoint set for a function in the controller .js file    h5. Steps to reproduce  Android OS tested: 2.3.6 Nexus One, Android emulator    See the sample attached.    h6. index.xml  {code}  <Alloy>  	<Window class=""container"">  		<Label id=""label"" onClick=""doClick"">Hello, World</Label>  	</Window>  </Alloy>  {code}    h6. index.js  {code}  function doClick(e) {    	      alert($.label.text);    }    $.index.open();  {code}    1. Set a BreakPpoint at line 3 for the'alert($.label.text);'  2. Debug the App on Android     Result: App starts but the breakpoint is immediately triggered before displaying the Window (so just the splashscreen is displayed) and without having to click on the label.    From the Debug tab, it looks the behavior is wrong and that actually the wrong line is highlighted, focusing on the 'doClick() function' instead of the 'alert' function inside.    See the two screenshots, one for Android (wrong behavior), one for iOS (correct one, being triggered only when clicking on the sample 'label' for displaying the alert, not when starting the App).    3. Click to go past the breakpoint. Manually click on the app label to trigger the alert again.  Result: breakpoint is now ignored. Alert is being displayed.

6814,Sync Tool: Add option to not overwrite changed files,"This task is to add an option to the Sync Tool which ensures that it does not overwrite any existing DuraCloud content. This means that when a file on the local file system, which has previously been added to DuraCloud, changes, it is not simply uploaded again.  There are a few choices that need to be made for this new feature to be added: 1. When a file already in DuraCloud changes on the file system, is the updated file transferred to DuraCloud or not. If so, the original file will likely need to be renamed to prevent collision. 2. How is the list of updated files communicated to the user. Are they printed to the console (stdout), or written to a file? Is this consistent between interactive mode and run-to-completion mode? 3. How does this feature impact the upload tool?  A comment from the State of North Carolina about how they envision this feature:  ""Our ideal upload tool would allow us to specify a local directory to update in the cloud, and the tool would then identify and upload new files (new files defined by file name and path), and alert us to any files that have changed (same file name and path but new checksum hash) and not upload the files that have changed (or upload them in a way that doesn't overwrite the files in the cloud).

2955,Remove pre-2.0 upgrade tasks and provide protection against upgrade from pre 2.0 version,"Krystian:  In the history of Bamboo we had several versions which were required to be used to upgrade to the newer version. Ie. to upgrade from Bamboo 1.0 to Bamboo 2.1 you need to execute upgrades to 1.1.2, 1.2 and 2.0.  The latest of this ""milestone-upgrade"" versions is 2.0. This is why I propose to drop all the upgrade tasks which were introduced by pre-2.0 versions. The main benefit would be dropping the last usages of old and usually deprecated APIs  According to https://extranet.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=636158922 it means all pre 801 upgrade tasks (18 of them)    Przemek:  + make it impossible to use new Bamboo version to upgrade from build number of pre-2.0.x version.  That check should have been included in 2.0.x anyway...    Marek:  +1, those upgrade tasks are in sources too long. For historical stuff we got subversion    Anton:  Yes, if we do this, Bamboo *must* lockup upon starting if it detects that it is being brought up against a version which is before 2.0.  We should also stop the user importing XML backups from pre 2.0 versions.  In all these cases the user should be given a very clear error message and no data should be changed.  Can I ask why do you bring this up now? What caused you to do this? If we do this, will this simplify some other work we need to do for 3.0?  How long will the work of stopping a pre 2.0 upgrade/import take?    Krystian:  Adding protection against upgrade/import from pre-2.0 version is rather simple and would require ~4h of work (including testing).  I'm bringing this now cause last week Przemek has spotted a small bug which was caused by internal use of deprecated API (BuildManager). I thought that releasing 3.0 is a good moment to drop this (and maybe other) legacy APIs which were deprecated in 2.7 and previous versions.  A lot of uses of deprecated API is buried in old upgrade tasks which led to idea I presented in my original email.  This will probably not simplify other work for 3.0 but has a potential to help us find forgotten usages of legacy code that should have been updated some time ago.",project4

1123,Framework can overcommit oversubscribable resources during master failover.,"This is due to a bug in the hierarchical allocator. Here is the sequence of events:    1) slave uses a fixed resource estimator which advertise 4 revocable cpus  2) a framework A launches a task that uses all the 4 revocable cpus  3) master fails over  4) slave re-registers with the new master, and sends UpdateSlaveMessage with 4 revocable cpus as oversubscribed resources  5) framework A hasn't registered yet, therefore, the slave's available resources will be 4 revocable cpus  6) framework A registered and will receive an additional 4 revocable cpus. So it can launch another task with 4 revocable cpus (that means 8 total!)    The problem is due to the way we calculate 'allocated' resource in allocator when 'updateSlave'. If the framework is not registered, the 'allocation' below is not accurate (check that if block in 'addSlave').    {code}  template <class RoleSorter, class FrameworkSorter>  void  HierarchicalAllocatorProcess<RoleSorter, FrameworkSorter>::updateSlave(      const SlaveID& slaveId,      const Resources& oversubscribed)  {    CHECK(initialized);    CHECK(slaves.contains(slaveId));      // Check that all the oversubscribed resources are revocable.

A string for platform type (""ios"") that will be used by CLI and other necessary operations;  3. A mean to check if the requirement for platform support is met, i.e. if the Titanium SDK contains the platform, if the platform SDK is installed (not applicable to Mobile Web), and if the OS supports the platform (not applicable here either), so the project wizard could enable/disable the checkbox as appropriate. It should return a status so we could display a warning or error message if needed.  4. Potentially a post-project creation hook to perform any iOS specific task needed (don't think we have any?).  5. An optional ""priority"" attribute to control the order of the platforms both here and in tiapp.xml. Currently we are sorting them in alphabetical order, but there might be a case in the future where we like to have the flexibility.  ",project8

2407,Service Activity Monitoring UI integrated with TAC,This backlog item should relay on results of TESB-1453. This is an email that was send by the end of the UI review:    Service Activity Monitoring UI will present an aggregated information about message exchanges to the user in following view:    http://screencast.com/t/OuUvudVX    View presents the events from SAM agents grouped by Flow ID therefore provides an important information on request-response total elapsed time (time between consumer sending request and receiving response). This view provides basic quick-filter fields where user could filter displayed information.    When user clicks on the one specific flow in the aggregated information table she would see a detailed information pane with full details of request/responses/faults that were part of selected message flow. Mockup of this pane is now in works and will be sent around later today.    We are also planning to provide an Advanced filter pop-up that will give users ability to fine-graned filtering of the SAM events:    http://screencast.com/t/tVyK4M4I    Please note that filtering based on custom fields is not in scope for June release.

1713,Add states to the deployment of stream,"Improve how the state of the stream is managed.    A deploy command moves the stream from the undeployed state to the deploying state. If all modules in the stream are successfully deployed, the stream state is ‘deployed’ If one or more module deployments failed, the stream state is failed.  Any modules that were successfully deployed, are still running.      Sending an undeploy command will stop all modules of the stream and return the stream to the undeployed state.    For the individual modules that failed, we will be able to find out which ones failed.  Not yet sure if we can try to redeploy just those parts of the stream that failed.

Much of the code for setting up this connection should be already available from the MC or Mill (share/reuse where possible).    Options for getting the database connection information:  - As system properties specified in JAVA_OPTS (using beanstalk environment variables, note that there is a 256 character limit)  - Use JAVA_OPTS to point to a config file S3 URL, and pull that in on startup.    In order for the DuraStore calls to complete quickly, and to keep the database load down, information from the DB should be cached.

2818,Only prompt user for overwrite when installing a Titanium SDK that already exists,"I'm not sure if we really intend to prompt or not, but every time a user installs/updates the SDK through Studio they will get an overwrite prompt about 3/4 in to the process because we overwrite existing modules with the same ones from the new SDK (in other words, it seems like modules aren't underneath the SDK version folder, but are shared).     The prompt itself makes it so you force user interaction to finish the install, but it also can scare the user into thinking we're blowing something away. Do we really want to prompt if the normal use case is that some files will get overwritten? Maybe the files getting overwritten don't really need to? (i.e. the modules have the exact same content, so we don't even need to copy them over - which maybe we can get by comparing an MD5 hash recursively and filtering out files that already exist in the destination?)",project8

7620,Download and index Node.js core modules for user (for version they have),We do support Node/NPM fairly well and can handle module require's decently. But one big hole in our support is that we don't try and force the user to grab the Node.js sources for the version they're using and index those core modules (where we can).

Open Studio and create a new project (or open an existing project).  2. Click in the text editor of app.js (or any .js file).  3. Press control + space to bring up the content assist menu.  4. Select any item from the suggestion list by clicking on it (the menu as-is will not exhibit this behavior).  5. Open any other program (such as Chrome) and move the other program window over the content assist menu.    Expected Result:    The content assist menu should disappear behind the other program window, as it should have the same OS hierarchy as Titanium Studio.    Actual Result:    The content assist menu persists and obfuscates the other program window until the focus shifts back to Studio.",project8

7647,Module message conversion fails to work if JMX is enabled,"If JMX is enabled for modules (enabling the IntegrationMBeanExporter), the ModuleTypeConversionPlugin fails to get the reference to input/output channel (for adding the ContentTypeHeaderInterceptor) and results in exception.    It seems like the IntegrationMBeanExporter (when JMX is enabled) creates JdkDynamicAopProxy for all the integration components and thereby the following check on ModuleTypeConversionPlugin to retrieve the AbstractMessageChannel fails.    AbstractMessageChannel channel = null;  			if (isInput) {  				channel = module.getComponent(""input"", AbstractMessageChannel.class);  			}  			else {  				channel = module.getComponent(""output"", AbstractMessageChannel.class);  			}    I see the reason why AbstractMessageChannel is used here (to use some of the methods in the implementing class that didn't exist in the interfaces) but IntegrationMBeanExporter creating JdkDynamicAopProxy for the channel fails to resolve as AbstractMessageChannel here.

Our current load provider support re-uses the index for the project, which isn't really correct - and it is assumed to return a lit of files to index, which we can do, but it may be easier to just return the directories.    Ideally the NodeJS install as a whole would be a single ""entry"" (like a JRE/KDK for JDT) and it resolves to it's various paths and is indexed to it's own index/indices. Then the projects just add them to their list of indices to search/query.",project8

5550,Improve module deployment distribution,"When a container joins the XD cluster (via ZooKeeper) it triggers stream/job module deployments for modules that need to be deployed. If multiple containers are being started at around the same time, this can result in the first few containers taking all of the deployments while leaving the rest without any deployments.    To solve this, we will introduce a ""quiet period"" where no deployments will be triggered within _n_ seconds of a container joining, where _n_ will have a default value (perhaps 5 to 10 seconds). This value will be configurable.",project6

We shouldn't need to do this, and should instead be able to simply add a new launch delegate, shortcut, config tab for the new mode.

We should be using that across all the modes of ""run"", ""debug"", ""profile"" and ""test"" - rather than defining a new launch config type for each mode.    This ticket is to remove the Android ""test on emulator"" launch config type, and then update the delegate, shortcut and tab group to point to the standard android device launch config type id (an attribute on the extension and for the classes usually one single reference to the id in code).

747,Studio: Hangs for a long duration when trying to access remote URL for the first time after launch,"h5. Description:  When importing an Existing Mobile Project for the first time after launching Studio, the process takes an abnormally long time, and studio becomes unresponsive. Import times vary between 1:30 - 2 minutes. Any subsequent imports (including different projects to the first) are instant. This occurs during the ""Project Directory"" selection, & before clicking ""Finish"". Closing Studio and relaunching will cause this issue to occur again. I've attached a Jstack log file of the process.    *Note:* This issue does not occur 100% of the times tested, But after repeating the above process 4 times, it occurred for 3 of them.     h5. Steps to reproduce:    1. Close Studio if already open.  2. Launch Studio.  3. Import Project.  4. Import Existing Mobile Project.  5. Click ""Browse"" and Navigate to a valid mobile project.  6. Issue should occur.  7. Repeat from steps 1 - 5.  8. Issue should not occur.     h5. Result:  OS loading pinwheel will appear and Studio will become unresponsive for a long duration.    h5. Expected Result:  Project directory selection for Importing existing mobile projects should be instant. ",project8
4279,Symlink the namespace handle with ContainerID for the port mapping isolator.,"This serves two purposes:  1) Allows us to enter the network namespace using container ID (instead of pid): ""ip netns exec <ContainerID> [commands] [args]"".  2) Allows us to get container ID for orphan containers during recovery. This will be helpful for solving MESOS-2367.    The challenge here is to solve it in a backward compatible way. I propose to create symlinks under /var/run/netns. For example:  /var/run/netns/containeridxxxx --> /var/run/netns/12345  (12345 is the pid)    The old code will only remove the bind mounts and leave the symlinks, which I think is fine since containerid is globally unique (uuid).",project5
347,Studio: Build for device and packaging show a list of simulators instead of SDK.,"While investigating issues discovered with Xcode 4.5, it became clear that what we were seeing as a bug where the SDK scripts were ignoring what was set as iOS SDK during Studio build for device or packaging was actually Studio displaying a list of simulator versions.    This option should show either the actual list of SDK versions. The result of setting something other than an available SDK is that the setting is ignored. Since this is a list of emulators, this happens nearly every build (unless you choose a version where you have both simulator and SDK).    This is not a regression, it occurs in many previous versions.     Steps to reproduce:  1) Ensure xcode-select path and Studio preference are in sync. (refresh and restart Studio if required)  2) run terminal command ""xcodebuild -showsdks"" for later comparison  3) Create a new project in Studio and attempt to build for device.  4) Note pull-down options    Result:  Pull-down contains a list of simulators. Check the xcodebuild results which should be something like:  {code}  OS X SDKs:  	Mac OS X 10.7                 	-sdk macosx10.7  	OS X 10.8                     	-sdk macosx10.8    iOS SDKs:  	iOS 6.0                       	-sdk iphoneos6.0    iOS Simulator SDKs:  	Simulator - iOS 5.0           	-sdk iphonesimulator5.0  	Simulator - iOS 5.1           	-sdk iphonesimulator5.1  	Simulator - iOS 6.0           	-sdk iphonesimulator6.0  {code}      Expected:  A list of SDKs.",project8

509,Framework failover when framework is 'active' does not trigger allocation.,"FWICT, this is just a consequence of some technical debt in the master code. When an active framework fails over, we do not go through the deactivation->activation code paths, and so:    (1) The framework's filters in the allocator remain after the failover.  (2) The failed over framework does not receive an immediate allocation (it has to wait for the next allocation interval).    If the framework had disconnected first, then the failover goes through the deactivation->activation code paths.    This also means that some tests take longer to run than necessary.",project5

The prompt in Studio should apply the same validation as the CLI.    !Screen Shot 2015-09-04 at 14.07.31.png!    * Why is the button titled _Configure Provisioning Profiles_ but is the title of the wizard _Configure Targets_?    !Screen Shot 2015-09-04 at 15.10.13.png!    !Screen Shot 2015-09-04 at 14.08.13.png!    * _Watch App XCode Path_ should be _Xcode Path_ (lowercase C and equal to Tiapp Editor).    * The wizard suggests that you select the targets here but deselecting doesn't effect the actual listed targets in the {{tiapp.xml}} in anyway. It just determines the choices given in the next step. So the wizard should either remove the unselected targets (and populate this list by reading the available targets in the Xcode project) or it might as well skip this step and show the next step right away for all targets.    * The Device provisioning profile list should default to the default development provisioning profile since that will probably be wildcard and what people use for this option.     !Screen Shot 2015-09-04 at 14.09.02.png!,project8
7335,As a Developer I want a better way to run shell commands,"When reviewing the code in [r/36425|https://reviews.apache.org/r/36425/] [~benjaminhindman] noticed that there is a better abstraction that is possible to introduce for {{os::shell()}} that will simplify the caller's life.    Instead of having to handle all possible outcomes, we propose to refactor {{os::shell()}} as follows:    {code}  /**   * Returns the output from running the specified command with the shell.   */  Try<std::string> shell(const string& command)  {    // Actually handle the WIFEXITED, WIFSIGNALED here!  }  {code}    where the returned string is {{stdout}} and, should the program be signaled, or exit with a non-zero exit code, we will simply return a {{Failure}} with an error message that will encapsulate both the returned/signaled state, and, possibly {{stderr}}.    And some test driven development:  {code}  EXPECT_ERROR(os::shell(""false""));  EXPECT_SOME(os::shell(""true""));    EXPECT_SOME_EQ(""hello world"", os::shell(""echo hello world""));  {code}    Alternatively, the caller can ask to have {{stderr}} conflated with {{stdout}}:  {code}  Try<string> outAndErr = os::shell(""myCmd --foo 2>&1"");  {code}    However, {{stderr}} will be ignored by default:  {code}  // We don't read standard error by default.  EXPECT_SOME_EQ("""", os::shell(""echo hello world 1>&2""));    // We don't even read stderr if something fails (to return in Try::error).  Try<string> output = os::shell(""echo hello world 1>&2 && false"");  EXPECT_ERROR(output);  EXPECT_FALSE(strings::contains(output.error(), ""hello world""));  {code}    An analysis of existing usage shows that in almost all cases, the caller only cares {{if not error}}; in fact, the actual exit code is read only once, and even then, in a test case.    We believe this will simplify the API to the caller, and will significantly reduce the length and complexity at the calling sites (<6 LOC against the current 20+).",project5

4277,REST representation of an aggregate-counter can lead to mixed up output,"The current representation of REST resources of time-series data (e.g. aggregate counter) can lead to problems in consuming applications.  Despite the time series data provided by the ""counts"" data structure is logically ordered by key (timestamps) it doesn't guarantee an ordering, since many consuming applications interpret JSON data as an unordered map like data structure.  Because of this consuming applications have to apply special ordering / transformation logic to get the data in an chronologically ordered fashion. It would be helpful if one could configure the rendering of the time series data, e.g. as a list of json object like: {code:json} {  ""ts"":""Sun Oct 12 23:10:23 CEST 2014""  ,""value"": 42 }  {code} Where {{ts}} denotes the timestamp and {{value}} denotes the value. It would also be helpful if one could adjust the date format either with a pattern or a well known date format like, c.f.  {{ISO 8601}}.  I attached a python example for this that demonstrates the problem.  Steps to reproduce: Create stream {code} xd:>stream create test --definition ""http | filter --expression=payload.contains('pivotal') | log"" {code}  Create tap on stream with aggregate-counter {code} xd:>stream create test_tap --definition ""tap:stream:test.filter > aggregate-counter"" {code}  Post some http data {code} xd:>http post --data ""Hello pivotal data labs"" #...some more data... {code}  Display aggregate counter {code} xd:>aggregate-counter display test_tap --resolution minute   AggregateCounter=test_tap   -----------------------------  -  -----   TIME                           -  COUNT   Sun Oct 12 23:10:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Sun Oct 12 23:11:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Sun Oct 12 23:12:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Sun Oct 12 23:13:23 CEST 2014  |  0   ...

We need to decouple this mess, and allow us to cleanly define the rules and requirements of our system.  I think we need to break it down into the following behaviors.    h1. Test Execution Environments    h2. Parallel Execution    This should be the default behavior.  All tests are assumed to be parallel    h2. Serial Execution    This should be the exception, and only used when parallel execution cannot be accomplished.  Tests in this classification should run in a method at a time, with no concurrency    h1. External resources    h2. Cassandra    # Configure the runtime  # Pre invocation hook  ## Create default implementation of truncating column families.  This should be manually added, and not execute by default.  # Post invocation hook    h2. ElasticSearch     # Configure the runtime  # Pre invocation hook  ## Create default implementation of truncating column families.  This should be manually added, and not execute by default.  # Post invocation hook    h1. Lifecycle    A test itself can have numerous lifecycle operations.  These should be set up as rules, both class and instance, and should NOT be done via inheritance of abstract tests.  This is the old Junit3 way of operating, and needs removed.  ",project3

In result during service call configuration will be applied by WSDL Policy client (in this case with UNT).    In Tooling we need to provide option what we want use Runtime Policies instead of setting manual security settings.  This option should be passed to Runtime (during export) to indicate this consumer wants to be configured by policies from the registry.

1915,Executors should not inherit environment variables from the agent.,"Currently executors are inheriting environment variables form the slave in mesos containerizer. This is problematic, because of two reasons:    1. When we use docker images (such as `mongo`) in unified containerizer, duplicated environment variables inherited from the slave lead to initialization failures, because LANG and/or LC_* environment variables are not set correctly.    2. When we are looking at the environment variables from the executor tasks, there are pages of environment variables listed, which is redundant and dangerous.    Depending on the reasons above, we propose that no longer allow executors to inherit environment variables from the slave. Instead, users should specify all environment variables they need by setting the slave flag `--executor_environment_variables` as a JSON format.",project5
6206,Studio: Updated modules delivered via CI builds are not replacing existing modules if they share the same name,"While evaluating ACS features, we encountered an Android issue that was supposed to have been fixed in the latest ti.cloud module.

We conducted a few experiments and determined that although the module was updated, the name was the same so during the unzipping process, the module was not replacing the existing older module.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Delete your existing common JS module folder from the Titanium folder  2) install a CI build from 3/24 or before  3) Check the contents of the module folder  4) install a CI build from 3/27 or later  5) Check the contents of the module folder    Results:  The ti.cloud module is the older broken module, not the newer fixed module    Expected:  The module is overwritten by the newer module with the same name.

1285,Implement stout/os/windows/killtree.hpp,killtree() is implemented using Windows Job Objects. The processes created by the  executor are associated with a job object using `create_job'. killtree() is simply terminating the job object.     Helper functions:  `create_job` function creates a job object whose name is derived from the `pid` and associates the `pid` process with the job object. Every process started by the process which is part of the job object becomes part of the job object. The job name should match the name used in `kill_job`. The jobs should be create with JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE and allow the caller to decide how to handle the returned handle.     `kill_job` function assumes the process identified by `pid` is associated with a job object whose name is derive from it. Every process started by the process which is part of the job object becomes part of the job object. Destroying the task will close all such processes.,project5

See #1 in the Doc (link to json output doc for spring batch).    *Implementation Suggestions*    There will need to be some SpringMVC setup that will enable the current style of spring-batch-admin controller requests to co-exist with the existing XD Controllers, e.g. the use of .json for json marshalling etc.  This may in fact be the bulk of time spend in this first story to integration spring-batch-admin style controllers into XD.

7556,"Code Analyzer: Alloy: When a Warning or Error is found for an Alloy project, code gutter icons are added to the Resources project files, not to App folder","h5. Problem description  When a Warning or Error is found by the Code Analyzer for an Alloy project, Warning or Error icons are placed in the code gutter in the Resources file projects instead than in the App file projects. The result is that the Project is now marked with the red/white error icon and the 'Errors in Workspace' alert is displayed every time the project is being build.     'Resources' folder is by default not visible for Alloy projects on Studio, so the default result is also that the project is marked with an error icon, but the user can't see any other red error icon next to any visible Project file.    Also, having an error or a warning reported for the Alloy compiled code in the Resources folder is not adding much value for the user as the intended behavior is not to manually modify the compiled code files in the Resources (user should only handle Alloy files, all included into the App folder).    h5. Steps to reproduce    Paste the sample code. Note the code error in the controller.js , where foobar is actually not a function.  The error is correctly reported by the Code Analyzer (see the screenshot), also getting the correct position in the Alloy project.  However, in Studio the Error icon is placed in 'Resources/alloy/controllers/index.js' , which is hidden by default and should in any case manually modified by the user.    h6. controller/index.js  {code}  $.mainwin.foobar({  	backgroundColor : 'blue'  });      $.index.open();  {code}    h6. index.xml  {code}  <Alloy>  	<Window title=""Win 1"" id='mainwin'>  		<Label>I am Window 1</Label>  		<Button>Click</Button>  	</Window>  </Alloy>  {code}      h5.

Split windows are pretty much the major reason I choose to use studio instead of sublime.",project8

3481,"Importing an Alloy project created using CLI, 'Resources' folder is shown","h6. Problem  Studio is showing the 'Resources' folder of an Alloy project if the project has been created using CLI and then imported    h6. Steps to reproduce  1. From Terminal, create a new project using CLI  $ ti create  2. cd to the newly created project and convert it to an Alloy project  $ alloy new  3.

9817,Add logic to validate for non-fractional GPU requests in the master,"We should not put this logic directly into the  'Resources::validate()' function.  The primary reason is that the existing 'Resources::validate()' function doesn't consider the semantics of any particular resource when performing its validation (it only makes sure that the fields in the 'Resource' protobuf message are correctly formed). Since a fractional 'gpus' resources is actually well-formed (and only semantically incorrect), we should push this validation logic up into the master.        Moreover, the existing logic to construct a 'Resources' object from a 'RepeatedPtrField<Resource>' silently drops any resources that don't pass 'Resources::validate()'. This means that if we were to push the non-fractional 'gpus' validation into 'Resources::validate()', the 'gpus' resources would just be silently dropped rather than causing a TASK_ERROR in the master. This is obviously *not* the desired behaviour.",project5

9437,Version the Operator/Admin API,"As a consumer of the Mesos HTTP API, it is necessary for us to determine the current version of Mesos so that we can parse the JSON documents returned correctly (since they change from version to version).     Currently we're doing this by fetching state.json, parsing it and pulling out the version field. A more idiomatic way to do this would be to filter on the content-type in the header itself.    To give a more concrete example, currently the JSON documents returned by the HTTP API return the following headers:  {code}  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Date: Fri, 23 Jan 2015 21:31:37 GMT  Content-Length: 9352  Content-Type: application/json  {code}    Something like the following (e.g. for master/state.json) would be easy to switch upon:  {code}  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Date: Fri, 23 Jan 2015 21:31:37 GMT  Content-Length: 9352  Content-Type: application/vnd.mesos.master.state.v0.20.1+json; charset=utf-8  {code}    The vnd prefix is typically used for vendor specific file types (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type#Prefix_vnd). Charset=utf-8 is required for JSON documents and is currently being omitted.    This content-type would change for each document type, for example:  {code}  application/vnd.mesos.master.state.v0.20.1+json; charset=utf-8  application/vnd.mesos.master.stats.v0.20.1+json; charset=utf-8  application/vnd.mesos.slave.state.v0.20.1+json; charset=utf-8  application/vnd.mesos.slave.stats.v0.20.1+json; charset=utf-8  {code}    Alternatively, the version could be appended as an extra field:  {code}  application/vnd.mesos.master.state+json; charset=utf-8; version=v0.20.1  application/vnd.mesos.master.stats+json; charset=utf-8; version=v0.20.1  application/vnd.mesos.slave.state+json; charset=utf-8; version=v0.20.1  application/vnd.mesos.slave.stats+json; charset=utf-8; version=v0.20.1  {code}    Thanks!",project5

3274,Runtime Update PoC,"In a first feature we investigated what the specific problems we encounter with update management in an OSGi environment and what the possible solutions are. This feature goes one step further where its goal is to make a PoC to provide a rudimentary update framework. It is assumed that the  new version does not override the old one but is installed beside the old one. So the goal of the updte framework is to take over user defined features / bundles / configurations and TESB Runtime configuration that was changed by the user, e.g port. Also it can be assumed that all user defined artifacts are still accessible and can be retrieved to be installed in the new container. Normallythey will reside in Archiva or some other Maven repository.    Basic idea is to have one component in the old container which retrieves a list of all feature repositories together with the url from which they were installed, and the list of all installed features. From these two lists the repositories and features that natively come with TESB runtime are removed. Another component in the new container is then responsible to take the list and make all feature repositories known in the container and to install all the features specified in the list.    For the configuration we either copy the whole ./etc directory from the old container to the new one and set the properties new for the current version via config admin or retrieve via config admin a list of all properties of the old container and apply it to the new conatiner. Make sure there is no conflict with configuration set when the usser defined features are installed.    Important is to validate the approach is feasable not to automate everything and to have a polished tooling. ",project1

7417,Allow master/agent to take multiple modules manifest files,"When loading multiple modules into master/agent, one has to merge all module metadata (library name, module name, parameters, etc.) into a single json file which is then passed on to the --modules flag. This quickly becomes cumbersome especially if the modules are coming from different vendors/developers.    An alternate would be to allow multiple invocations of --modules flag that can then be passed on to the module manager. That way, each flag corresponds to just one module library and modules from that library.    Another approach is to create a new flag (e.g., --modules-dir) that contains a path to a directory that would contain multiple json files. One can think of it as an analogous to systemd units. The operator that drops a new file into this directory and the file would automatically be picked up by the master/agent module manager. Further, the naming scheme can also be inherited to prefix the filename with an ""NN_"" to signify oad order.",project5

Narrative  As a developer, I need to be able to create a Spring XD job module that consists of a job orchestrating the execution of other Spring Batch jobs using the Spring Batch Job Step (see section 5.3.6 here: http://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/reference/html/configureStep.html) within the same module definition.    h3.  Acceptance Criteria  # Define the ""contract"" for a job module  ## Currently the contract consists of a single job definition within the assembled {{ApplicationContext}} ({{context.getBean(Job.class)}}).  ## The new version will need to document what job definition within the assembled {{ApplicationContext}} should be run as the entry point.  I'm assuming it would be by id ({{context.getBean(""job"")}} for example) of the job but am open to other options.  # A custom job module that orchestrates multiple Spring Batch jobs via Job steps should be able to be deployed and executed as a single Spring XD module.  ## Spring XD launches the job that conforms to the previously defined ""contract"".  ## Spring Batch manages the execution of the child jobs.  # The existing OOTB jobs should work under the new ""contract"".    h3.  Assumptions  # The UI should ""just work"" in that child jobs update the job repository independently so no updates should be needed for an MVP of this functionality.  # *This will be a breaking change for users that have developed custom job modules.*    h3.  Out of Scope  # Execution of child jobs that are remote (deployed on another node / {{ApplicationContext}}).  # Dynamically assembling jobs via the shell's DSL or the UI.  ",project6

4771,Allow resources/attributes discovery,"In heterogeneous clusters, tasks sometimes have strong constraints on the type of hardware they need to execute on. The current solution is to use custom resources and attributes on the agents. Detecting non-standard resources/attributes requires wrapping the ""mesos-slave"" binary behind a script and use custom code to probe the agent. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't allow composition. The solution would be to provide a hook/module mechanism to allow users to use custom code performing resources/attributes discovery.    Please review the detailed document below:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/15OkebDezFxzeyLsyQoU0upB0eoVECAlzEkeg0HQAX9w    Feel free to express comments/concerns by annotating the document or by replying to this issue.

Upgrade the schedulers by linking the latest native library and mesos jar (if necessary).  Restart the schedulers.  Install the new slave binaries and restart the slaves.  Upgrade the executors by linking the latest native library and mesos jar (if necessary).  {code}    Instructions to this effect should be featured prominently in the doc.",project5

5882,Slave should call into resource estimator whenever it wants to forward oversubscribed resources,"Currently, the polling of resource estimator is decoupled from the loop in the slave that forwards oversubscribed resources.    Now that the slave only sends updates when there is a change from the previous estimate, it can just poll the resource estimator whenever it wants to send an estimate. One advantage with this is that if the estimator is slow to respond, the slave doesn't keep forwarding estimates with the stale 'oversubscribable' value causing more revocable tasks to be unintentionally launched.",project5

5035,Refactor the C++ Resources abstraction for DiskInfo,"As we introduce DiskInfo and reservation for Resource. We need to change the C++ Resources abstraction to properly deal with merge/split of resources with those additional fields.    Also, the existing C++ 'Resources' interfaces are poorly designed. Some of them are confusing and unintuitive. Some of them are overloaded with too many functionalities. For instance,    {noformat}  bool operator <= (const Resource& left, const Resource& right);  {noformat}    This interface in non-intuitive because A <= B doesn't imply !(B <= A).    {noformat}  Resource operator + (const Resource& left, const Resource& right);  {noformat}    This one is also non-intuitive because if 'left' is not compatible with 'right', the result is 'left' (why not right???). Similar for operator '-'.    {noformat}  Option<Resource> Resources::get(const Resource& r) const;  {noformat}    This one assume Resources is flattened, but it might not be.    As we start to introduce persistent disk resources (MESOS-1554), things will get more complicated. For example, one may want to get two types of 'disk()' functions: one returns the ephemeral disk bytes (with no disk info), one returns the total disk bytes (including ones that have disk info). We may wanna introduce a concept about Resource that indicates that a resource cannot be merged or split (e.g., atomic?).    Since we need to change this class anyway. I wanna take this chance to refactor it.",project5
6485,Save Project as Alloy / TiClassic Template,"Many of our customers would like to make it much easier to create and share content, in particular base templates to make starting projects much easier. For example, I could create a project that has our standard login widget, and corporate theme. Additionally, it may have specific connection widgets/modules to my backend data sources. This would act as my standard template whenever i want to start a new project.     We should provide a way to save an existing project as an Alloy or TiClassic Template (based on the nature of the project), which would then be added as part of a new ruble bundle or added to an existing bundle.

4222,Create a packaging model for custom modules,"Like just discussed after the Spring One session, it would be nice to have a packaging model for custom modules. Instead of putting all libs in one directory and an XML in another, it could be a fat jar including some metadata file pointing to either an XML or to a JavaConfig configuration class inside the jar. Some more words why I think it's important to have something like that: Spring XD can be very well used in the enterprise, and at least for job modules it's likely to have some dependencies. So what do you have to do now to deploy such a module? Build a jar with your build process, then get it from your repository, unpack it and somehow find the relevant XML to copy it into the appropriate folder, then inspect the POM to find out what all the dependencies are, direct and transient, and get them from your repository to copy them into the appropriate folder. And of course, copy the jar. And when using Spring XD in distributed mode, you have to do it several times. With the approach mentioned above you just build your fat jar with your build process and distribute it to all your nodes, nothing complicated.  And if you implement it like that it's easy to have a JavaConfig support that's almost the same.",project6

3574,Create documentation on the lifcycle of a job in XD,"This should go in the first section of the Batch Job documentation.    Here is a rough suggestion    The lifecycle of a job in XD.    1. Register a job module with the MoudleRegistry by putting a XML/jar files in the $XD_HOME/modules/jobs directory.  2. Create a job definition from a job module by providing a name and properties that apply to all job instances can be configured at this point.  The job is not yet deployed  3. Deploy the job to an xd-container.  A job instance can not be created by sending a message to a job queue that contains optional runtime job parameters  4. Launch a job by sending a message to the job queue with job parametres.  A Job Instance is created, representing a specific run of the job.  A Job Instance is the Job Definition plus the runtime job parameters.  You can query for the Job Instances associated with a given job name  5. The job is executed creating a Job Exection object that captures the success or failure of the job.  You can query for the Job Executions associated with a given job name.  6. Undeploy a job.  This removes the job from xd-container.",project6

From the HTTP API design doc:  Master encodes each Event in RecordIO format, i.e. a string representation of length of the event in bytes followed by JSON or binary Protobuf  (possibly compressed) encoded event.    As of now for getting the basic features right , this is being done in the test-cases:    {code}    auto reader = response.get().reader;    ASSERT_SOME(reader);      Future<std::string> eventFuture = reader.get().read();    AWAIT_READY(eventFuture);      Event event;    event.ParseFromString(eventFuture.get());  {code}    Two things need to happen:  - We need master to emit events in RecordIO format i.e. event size followed by the serialized event instead of just the serialized events as is the case now.  - The decoder class should then abstract away the logic of reading the response and de-serializing events from the stream.    Ideally, the decoder should work with both ""json"" and ""protobuf"" responses.  ",project5

3817,Test build participant infrastructure,"This involves taking the current built participant infrastructure, reviewing the test plans and unit tests, and performing the tests.    Current wiki: https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tp/TiStudio+Build+Participant+Test+Plan    Suggested approach:    * Review the above test plan. The list of test cases is incomplete. Don't worry about fleshing them out fully. Instead, take Chris's feedback and Thomas's feedback (shown below) to create a set of test scenarios at the top of the file and run through those. We will leave the creation of exhaustive test cases to later when we have more QA resources.  * Review the unit tests. See if they exercise the functionality. Run them through Emma to check for code coverage  * Run the test scenarios and file any bugs found.    To Test:  Checkout the ""participant"" branch of studio3, studio3-ruby and studio3-php    Thomas's feedback:  * All tests are marked as full. The point of a test plan is to break functionality into smoke, acceptance and full levels of test. If the tester can't figure out these coverage levels, they need to work with dev to figure it out.  * Resource requirements are not filled out - now way of knowing from this plan what Os are being tested or targeted  * An actual description of what ""Build Participant functionality"" is would be helpful if the test plan is going to be run by anyone other than the author. There seems to be multiple features in the test cases  * No risks or assumptions are filled out  * Often missing set up steps - For the PHP and Ruby specific test cases, how do we setup our environment to test those test cases?  * Under genericized tests, it says ""Applicable to all languages."" Which programming languages is being tested: JS, Java, Objective C?  * Unclear if it applies to Aptana or Tistudio.   * Not seeing links to any dev specs: http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tis/Participating+in+the+build+and+reconcile+process    Ignore for now:    * Overall, the test cases should be more detailed since the test plan seems to be dealing with different programatic syntax and the test plan needs to clearly define what it is testing. (ignore for now)  * Not sure of why the tests at the top are repeated from 1012 on with a ""syntactically sound"" js file. Is there a target for this specific set of tests?  * In the ""Declarations and documentation"" tests, need specific examples for the programatic syntax (e.g. Document a class, declare a class, declare a function etc.)  * 1112 - 1115 refer to Aptana Studio. Also the location is Mac-only for the preferences. Unless the testing is Mac only either leave out the menu path or put Linux and Win info too.  ",project8

8649,Allow Docker v1 ImageManifests to be parsed from the output of `docker inspect`,"    The `docker::spec::v1::ImageManifest` protobuf implements the      official v1 image manifest specification found at:            https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/image/spec/v1.md            The field names in this spec are all written in snake_case as are the      field names of the JSON representing the image manifest when reading      it from disk (for example after performing a `docker save`). As such,      the protobuf for ImageManifest also provides these fields in      snake_case. Unfortunately, the `docker inspect` command also provides      a method of retrieving the JSON for an image manifest, with one major      caveat -- it represents all of its top level keys in CamelCase.            To allow both representations to be parsed in the same way, we      should intercept the incoming JSON from either source (disk or `docker      inspect`) and convert it to a canonical snake_case representation.",project5
5465,Studio: Selecting vpc and then enabling services fails to manage keys correctly,h5. I have yet to determine if this is a regression. Updates to follow.    h5. Description:  I created a project without services enabled in a multi-vpc environment. I then selected a vpc using the studio drop-down. This presented an error as shown in the screenshot from 3:57:21. I then tried to enable services which failed with errors as shown in the screenshot from 3:57:56. Then trying to set a vpc failed with the error as shown in the screenshot from 3:58:07    h5. Steps to reproduce:  1) Create a new project in Studio (classic two-tab) with NO SERVICES enabled in a multi vpc environment.  2) Set the vpc pull-down to a vpc - note failure  3) Enable services - note failure  4) Set the vpc - note failures    h5. Result:  Many failures - assuming inability to use services.    h5. Expected Result:  Service enablement and key handling work as expected regardless of order performed.    NOTE: This does not occur if the vpc is NOT selected prior to enabling services.,project8
8358,Modify cBean To Register Beans with Container,"cBean only creates anonymous beans based on a Class rather than Objects.  These anonymous beans cannot be configured using constructors.  As a result the user is forced to configure them with code rather than GUI.    In addition, there is no singleton object, so references to the Bean  different routes end up created different Bean instances which are unaware of each other.  Even in the cConfig section because there is no means of getting a handle to them.    As a result the user is left writing Java code without a real object based component framework.  It is important that our code generator generates code which uses a solid component framework rather than building from the ground up.  While the user or us could reinvent the wheel, it is important that our components build and extend existing frameworks correctly.    The Camel Context Registry interface is can _lookup_ beans, but the bean id is required.  The Camel Registry does not serve to register beans.  So the best solution would be to inject an abstraction of the container that allows registration of beans.      These beans should be fairly general so their properties can be configured by the user without writing code.  An important ability is for Beans to refer to other Beans via their properties.    Like the cConfig bean they are not directly connected to Routes.  Instead, they are connected to Routes via the cBean with a ref property.  Like cConfig, and unlike the EIP oriented elements, the beans are referenced by the flow rather than participating directly in the wiring.  So it may make sense to have another Resource or Bean tab perspective (like the code or design tabs) that shows the wiring of these static resources.  This keeps separation of concerns between resource structure and message flow.",project1
1057,Allow operators to assign net_cls major handles to mesos agents,The net_cls cgroup allows operators to assign a 16-bit major and 16-bit minor network handle to tasks associated with a specific net_cls cgroup. In mesos we need to give the operator the ability to fix the 16-bit major handle used in an agent. Fixing the parent handle on the agent allows operators to install default firewall rules using the parent handle to enforce a default policy (say DENY ALL) for all container traffic till the container is allocated a minor handle.     A simple way to achieve this requirement is to pass the major handle as a flag to the agent at startup. ,project5

2830,"Subprocess is ""slow"" -> gated by process::reap poll interval","Subprocess uses process::reap to wait on the subprocess pid and set the exit status. However, process::reap polls with a one second interval resulting in a delay up to the interval duration before the status future is set.    This means if you need to wait for the subprocess to complete you get hit with E(delay) = 0.5 seconds, independent of the execution time. For example, the MesosContainerizer uses mesos-fetcher in a Subprocess to fetch the executor during launch. At Twitter we fetch a local file, i.e., a very fast operation, but the launch is blocked until the mesos-fetcher pid is reaped -> adding 0 to 1 seconds for every launch!    The problem is even worse with a chain of short Subprocesses because after the first Subprocess completes you'll be synchronized with the reap interval and you'll see nearly the full interval before notification, i.e., 10 Subprocesses each of << 1 second duration with take ~10 seconds!    This has become particularly apparent in some new tests I'm working on where test durations are now greatly extended with each taking several seconds.",project5

8341,Switch to using Findbugs rank over priority,"Findbugs (and the Jenkins plugin) defaults to using ""priority"" for sorting issues into high/normal/low. The reality is that ""priority"" was defined as closer to ""confidence level"" in the way it's used.  With Findbugs 2.0 they introduced ""rank"" which is the notion of how ""scary"" a bug is. I'd argue that's a better thing for us to track and determine the high/normal/low values and thresholds to use.    The plugin doesn't let you change how the mapping is done, so I looked at the source and it appears to be:  1-4: High  5-9: Normal  10+: Low.    (Compare this to Findbugs definition: scariest (rank 1-4), scary (rank 5-9), troubling (rank 10-14), and of concern (rank 15-20).)",project8

4634,Instance not initialized call should return something other than a 503,Each of the DuraCloud apps currently responds to a /init REST call with either a 200 if the app is initialized and ready for use or a 503 if the app is available but not yet initialized.    This task is to update this to change the 503 to another code. The reason is that Apache also returns 503 responses as a DuraCloud instance is starting when it is not yet able to make a connection to Tomcat. This results in the Management Console thinking that an instance is ready to be initialized when  it is not yet available.    Note that this change will require a companion change in the MC to ensure that the correct HTTP code is expected on init.,project2

2707,Mesos Lifecycle Modules,"A new kind of module that receives callbacks at significant life cycle events of its host libprocess process. Typically the latter is a Mesos slave or master and the life time of the libprocess process coincides with the underlying OS process.     h4. Motivation and Use Cases    We want to add customized and experimental capabilities that concern the life time of Mesos components without protruding into Mesos source code and without creating new build process dependencies for everybody.     Example use cases:  1. A slave or master life cycle module that gathers fail-over incidents and reports summaries thereof to a remote data sink.  2. A slave module that observes host computer metrics and correlates these with task activity. This can be used to find resources leaks and to prevent, respectively guide, oversubscription.  3. Upgrades and provisioning that require shutdown and restart.    h4. Specifics    The specific life cycle events that we want to get notified about and want to be able to act upon are:    - Process is spawning/initializing  - Process is terminating/finalizing    In all these cases, a reference to the process is passed as a parameter, giving the module access for inspection and reaction.     h4. Module Classification    Unlike other named modules, a life cycle module does not directly replace or provide essential Mesos functionality (such as an Isolator module does). Unlike a decorator module it does not directly add or inject data into Mesos core either.",project5

Usergrid should not depend on a commercial service and the Usergrid Launcher should be able to run standalone and without external services.    So, what we need is a Queue implementation that we can embed in Usergrid for running JUnit tests that depend on the queue, for running the Usergrid Launcher and (ideally) one that can also be run remotely.    Apache Qpid seems to be a good candidate for our default queue implementation.",project3
6465,Ability to stop a queued job via action menu,For stop button for a job in the action menu only shows up when the job is actually running not while it is queued.  It should show while its queued.    The fix needs to ensure that the button doesn't show up when the job's stage hasn't been kicked off yet.,project4

Did you mean '--hadoopDistro hadoop12'?  Since hdp13 uses hadoop 1.2.0, we need to fix that in the versions map ContainerOptions.getHadoopDistroVersions()",project6
5747,Introduce a port field in `ImageManifest` in order to set exposed ports for a container.,Networking isolators such as `network/cni` need to learn about ports that a container wishes to be exposed to the outside world. This can be achieved by adding a field to the `ImageManifest` protobuf and allowing the `ImageProvisioner` to set these fields to inform the isolator of the ports that the container wishes to be exposed. ,project5
2303,Add ability to run a project without importing it first,"I'd like to be able to run a project (in the simulator/emulator at least) without having to import the project. This would be especially useful in a learning or training environment where we're working with many different projects. It would be helpful when users try out code from github, etc. Seems like tiapp.xml would give you all the info you need.",project8

3100,Multiple use of term repository in Service Builder,"In the settings view for a tESBProvider* you can configure the schema used. You can choose Built-in or Repository. When you choose _Repository_ you actually get the content of the _Services_ category, not the metadata.    If you want to get the same thing in tXMLMap and you choose _Import from Repository on a payload element, you get the content of the metadata in the repository, not the stuff under _Services_.    This is IMO misleading. Either use proper names so that users can distinguish what actually is used. -Or better, fix the relationship between the data under _Services_ and XML metadata.- (Removed by Renat)",project1
